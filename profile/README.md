# Weather and Climate Modelling Research Group

Welcome to the Weather and Climate Modelling Research Group's official GitHub organization page. Our group, led by Principal Investigator Dr. Raju Attada, focuses on advancing the understanding of weather and climate systems through innovative modeling and simulation techniques. We are committed to developing open-source tools and datasets that support the global research community's efforts in climate science.
<!--
## Our Mission

Our mission is to contribute to the global effort of understanding and predicting climate and weather patterns, with a focus on improving the accuracy and reliability of these predictions. Through collaborative research, we aim to develop solutions that address some of the most pressing environmental challenges facing our planet today.

## Research Areas

Our research encompasses a broad range of topics within weather and climate science, including but not limited to:

- Climate change modelling and impact assessment
- Weather prediction algorithms and systems
- Data assimilation techniques for improving model accuracy
- Development of open-source modeling tools and frameworks
- Analysis of extreme weather events and their implications

## How to Get Involved

We welcome collaboration from researchers, developers, and institutions interested in weather and climate science. Here are a few ways you can get involved:
